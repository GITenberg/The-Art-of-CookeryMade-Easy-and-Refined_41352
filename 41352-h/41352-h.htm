<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap"><span class='big'><b>T</b></span>he</span> mode of cookery which the author
of the following sheets has pursued for a
series of years having obtained the most
distinguished approbation of the public,
has induced him to commit his practice
to paper; in doing which, a deviation
has been made from the usual introductory
methods of other treatises of
the kind, in omitting to give particular
directions for the choice of fish, meats,
poultry, and vegetables, and at what
times they respectively might be in season,
&amp;c. &amp;c. the author conceiving the
simpler method to be the most acceptable:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and, therefore, as actual knowledge
must ever supersede written forms,
he would advise a frequent attendance at
the different markets, fully assured that
experience will convey greater instruction
in marketing than all the theories which
could be advanced. There are, nevertheless,
some useful observations interspersed
in the course of the work for
that purpose; the author having confined
himself chiefly to the practical part of
cookery; he has also given some directions
in a branch of the confectionary
business: in both of which it has been
his constant endeavour that they might
be rendered as simple and easy as possible,
and that economy might pervade
the whole.</div>

<p>The receipts are written for the least
possible quantities in the different made-dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and sauces, it being a frequent
error in most of the books that they are
too expensive and too long; by which
means the art has been rendered intricate
in the extreme, both in theory and
practice.</p>

<p>Independent, also, of a close adherence
to any given rules, there are other qualities
essential to the completion of a
thorough cook; such as, an acute taste,
a fertile invention, and a rigid attention
to cleanliness.</p>

<p>The preceding hints and subsequent
directions, it is hoped, will prove fully
adequate to perfection in cookery; the
work being entirely divested of the
many useless receipts from other professions,
(which have been uniformly
introduced in books of the like nature,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and nothing inserted but what has an
immediate reference to the art itself.</p>

<p>There is prefixed a Bill of Fare for each
month in the year, as a specimen of the
seasons, which may be altered as judgment
directs. There is annexed, also, at
the end of the volume, an Index, by
which, from the first letter or word of
the different articles, will be found their
respective receipts.</p>

<h2>THE<br />

ART <span class="smcap">of</span> COOKERY.</h2>


<div class='center'><i>Beef Stock.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='big'><span class="smcap">Cut</span></span> chuck beef into pieces, put it into
a pot, set it on the fire, with a sufficient
quantity of water to cover it. When it
boils skim it clean; add a bunch of parsley
and thyme, cleaned carrots, leeks, onions,
turnips, celery, and a little salt. Let
the meat boil till tender, skim off the
fat, then strain it through a fine hair
sieve.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Veal Stock, for Soups.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> a leg of veal and some lean ham,
cut them into pieces, put them into a
pan with a quart of water, some peeled
carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celery;
draw them down till nearly tender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
but of no colour; then add a sufficient
quantity of beef stock to cover the ingredients,
boil all together one hour, skim
it free from fat, and strain it. Some
game drawn down with it will make it
excellent.</div>

<p>N. B. I have directed the veal stock
not to be drawn down to a colour, as in
that state it will answer two purposes;
first, for white soups; and, secondly, as
it might be coloured with a bright liquid
to any height, which will be directed for
gravy soups. It frequently happens, likewise,
that, if not strictly attended to, it
will burn.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Consum&eacute;, or the Essence of Meat.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Reduce</span> veal stock to a good consistence,
but be careful not to let it colour.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Cullis, or a thick Gravy.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> slices of ham, veal, celery, carrots,
turnips, onions, leeks, a small bunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of sweet herbs, some allspice, black pepper,
mace, a piece of lemon-peel, and
two bay leaves; put them into a pan with
a quart of water, and draw them down
till of a light brown colour, but be careful
not to let it burn; then discharge it
with beef stock. When it boils, skim it
very clean from fat, and thicken it with
flour and water, or flour and butter passed.
Let it boil gently three quarters of
an hour; season it to the palate with
cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt;
strain it through a tamis cloth or sieve,
and add a little liquid of colour, which
may be made as in the following receipt.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Liquid of Colour for Sauces, &amp;c.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Put</span> a quarter of a pound of the best
brown sugar into a frying pan very clean
from grease, and half a gill of water; set it
over a gentle fire, stirring it with a wooden
spoon till it is thoroughly burnt and
of a good bright colour, then discharge
it with water; when it boils skim it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
strain it. Put it by for use in a vessel
close covered.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Benshamelle.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> white veal, lean ham, turnips,
celery, onions cut in pieces, a blade of
mace, a little whole white pepper; sweat
them down till three parts tender, then
discharge it with beef stock. Let it boil,
skim it clean, and thicken with flour and
water, or flour and butter passed; add to
it a sufficient quantity of cream to make
it quite white. Let it simmer gently half
an hour, and strain it through a tamis
cloth.</div>

<p>N. B. Let it be of the thickness of
light batter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>To make a passing of Flour and Butter for
Cullis or Benshamelle.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Put</span> fresh butter into a stewpan over a
fire, when it is melted add a sufficient
quantity of sifted flour to make it into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
paste, and mix them together with a whisk
over a very slow fire for ten minutes.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Soup a la Reine.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> three quarts of veal stock with
a blade of mace boiled in it; then strain
it to the crumb of four penny french
rolls, three quarters of a pound of sweet
almonds blanched and pounded very fine,
likewise the white meat of dressed fowl
pounded. Let all simmer together for
ten minutes, and rub them through a
tamis cloth till the soup is of a proper
thickness; season it to the palate with
salt; make it boil, and serve it up with
a gill of cream in it.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Crayfish Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> three quarts of veal stock, the
crumb of four penny french rolls, the
meats of a hen lobster, and half a hundred
crayfish pounded, with some live lobster
spawn; add all together, make it boil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
skim it clean, rub it through a tamis
cloth, make it of a middling thickness,
and season to the palate with salt and a
little cayenne pepper. Serve it up with
crust of french bread cut into small
round pieces.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Vermicelli Soup, white.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> three quarts of veal stock and
two ounces of vermicelli, boil them together
a quarter of an hour, rub it through
a tamis cloth, season with salt, make it
boil, skim it, and add a leason. Let it
simmer for five minutes.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>To make the Leason.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> the yolks of four eggs, half a
pint of cream, and a little salt, mixed
well together.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Cleared brown Stock for Gravy Soups.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> three quarts of veal stock perfectly
free from fat; add a small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of liquid colour to make it of a fine
brown; season to the palate with salt and
a little cayenne pepper; beat up together
two yolks, two whites, and two shells of
eggs; whisk them with the stock, set it
over a fire, let it boil gently ten minutes,
then strain it through a tamis cloth. This
stock is required for rice, brown vermicelli,
celery, sant&eacute;, or turnip soups.</div>

<p>N. B. I have directed the brown stock,
for gravy soups only, to be cleared with
eggs, as that method has been most approved,
it being pleasant to the eye, and
equally agreeable to the palate.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Rice Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Add</span> to three quarts of cleared stock
two ounces of rice, washed, picked, parboiled,
and drained dry. Let it boil gently
till the rice is tender.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Celery Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Cut</span> celery heads two inches long then,
some of the white part into small pieces;
wash, blanch, and drain it, and put to
it three quarts of cleared stock. Make it
boil, skim it, and let the celery simmer
till tender.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Turnip Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Pare</span> good and firm turnips, cut them
with a knife or scoop into shapes, fry them
with a bit of lard till of a light brown
colour, then drain and wipe them free
from fat (or they may be steamed with a
very little water, to prevent them from
burning, till they are half done); then put
to them cleared stock, and boil them
gently till tender.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Cressey Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> twelve large red carrots, scrape
them clean, cut off only the red part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
thin slices, and put them in a stewpan
with a quart of water; add cleaned turnips,
celery, leeks, and onions, cut in pieces,
and half a pint of split peas. Stew all together
till tender, adding some stock to
prevent burning; then rub it through a
tamis, and put to the pulp five pints of
veal stock and some blanched water-cresses;
make it boil for twenty minutes, skim
it, season it with salt, and serve it up.</div>

<p>N. B. To be the thickness of peas
soup.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Sant&eacute;, or Spring Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Pare</span>, and cut into shapes, turnips and
carrots, likewise celery heads about two
inches long; wash them, and steam them
separately with a very little water till they
are three parts done; then cut the white
part of the celery into small pieces, likewise
leeks, cabbage, cos lettuces, endive,
and chervil, of each a small quantity;
blanch and drain them dry, then put all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the vegetables together; add to them three
quarts of cleared brown stock, and boil
them gently till tender. In spring add
young green peas, tops of asparagus, and
button onions, steamed as the above.</div>

<p>N. B. A small piece of bouillie beef may
be stewed till tender; and ten minutes
before it is to be served up wipe it dry,
and put it into the soup with the vegetables.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Onion Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> eight middling-sized peeled onions,
cut them into very thin slices, pass
them with a quarter of a pound of fresh
butter and flour till tender; then add
three quarts of veal stock; make it boil
twenty minutes; skim it, season it with
salt, and add a leason; mix it well with
a whisk, make it simmer, and serve it
up.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Green Peas Soup.</i></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Take</span> one quart of young green peas,
four turnips pared and cut in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dice, two cos lettuces cut in small slices,
two middling-sized onions cut very fine;
wash them, add a quarter of a pound of
fresh butter, and stew them till nearly
done. Then take two quarts of large fresh
green peas, and boil them in three quarts of
veal stock till tender; strain and pound
them, preserving the liquor; then rub the
peas through a tamis, and add the pulp
with the liquor to the above herbs, a little
flour and water, pepper and salt, and season
to the palate, with a bit of sugar if
approved. Boil all together half an hour;
skim it and when it is to be served up,
add the pulp of some boiled parsley rubbed
through a tamis to make it look
green.</div>

<p>N. B. Cut pieces of bread into thin

fins and all the meat from the bones,
callipee and callipash; then chop the callipee

marjoram, savory, thyme, parsley, a
very little basil, some chopped onions,
some beaten spices, as allspice, a few
cloves, a little mace, black pepper, salt,
some veal stock, and the liquor that was
reduced. Boil the meat till three parts
done, pick it free from herbs, strain the
liquor through a tamis sieve, make a passing
of flour and three quarters of a pound
of fresh butter, mixing it well over a fire
for some time, and then add to it madeira
wine, (if a turtle of seventy pounds weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
three pints,) and the liquor of the meat.
When it boils, skim it clean, season to
the palate with cayenne pepper, lemon
juice, and salt, and strain it to the pieces
of fins and shell in one pot, and the lean
meat into another; and if the turtle produce
any real green fat, let it be boiled
till done, then strained, cut into pieces,
and added to the fins and shell, and then
simmer each meat till tender. When it
is to be served up, put a little fat at the
bottom of the tureens, some lean in the
center, and more fat at the top, with
egg and force-meat balls, and a few
entrails.</div>

<p>N. B. The entrails must be cleaned
well, then boiled in water till very tender,

it boils skim clean; then add carrots,
celery, turnips, onions, leeks, garlick,
parsley, and thyme, tied in a bunch;
allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper,
mace, and a little ginger, put in a cloth.
Boil all together till it becomes a strong
stock, and strain it. Then cut the breast
of veal into tendrons, and best end of
neck of mutton into steaks, and half fry
them; pigs feet and ears cleaned; hare
cut into joints and daubed with bacon;
bouillie beef tied round with packthread;

that was strained. When the different
things are braised enough, pour the
liquors from them into a pan, leaving a
little with each to preserve from burning.
When they are to be served up,
skim the liquor very clean, and clear
it with whites of eggs; then cut turnips
and carrots into haricots, some button
onions peeled, and heads of celery
trimmed neat; after which blanch them,
cut the bologna sausage into slices, boil

When the season will permit let it hang

that period bring it to its best state.
Poultry, likewise, should be chosen tolerably
fat and of a soft grain. Let them
hang three or four days, which will add
to their better eating; except woodcocks,
snipes, larks, or pigs, which should be
dressed fresh. Be particular that the

and that it be put into a well-cleaned
copper or brass-preserving pan
just before it is to be put over the fire,
and when it boils not to remain in the

<p>There can be no occasion of the many
arts that are used in order to preserve
the ingredients green, if the vegetables
are gathered fresh, on a dry day,

might be attended with greater expence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

set it over a fire, and when the liquor
is sufficiently drawn from the mushrooms
put the whole into glasses and

<p>The general rule has been deviated

<div class='center'><br /><i>Observations in respect of Fish Sauces, &amp;c.</i></div>

fish sauces should be of the thickness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
light batter, so that it might adhere to
the fish when dressed, it being a frequent
error that they are either too thick or too
thin. The thickening should be made
with the best white flour sifted, and some
water, mixed smooth with a wooden
spoon or a whisk, and to be of the consistence
of light batter also. A little of
it is recommended to be always ready
where there is much cooking, as it is frequently
wanted both in fish and other
sauces.</div>

<p>There are, likewise, other articles repeatedly
wanted for the use of stovework;
and as their possession has
been found to obviate much inconvenience
and trouble, they are here
enumerated: that is to say, liquid of colour
preserved in a bottle, strained lemon
juice preserved in the same manner,
cayenne pepper, ground spices, ground
pepper and salt mixed, which should be
preserved separately in small jars; and
every day, when wanted, fresh breadcrumbs
rubbed through a hair sieve;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
parsley, thymes, eschallots, savoy, marjoram,
and lemon peel, chopped very
fine, and put on a dish in separate
partitions.</p>

<p>Directions are not given for serving
the fish sauces with any particular kind
of fish,&mdash;such as turbot or salmon with
lobster sauce, &amp;c. but the receipts have
been written only for the making them;
therefore it is recommended that every
person make a choice, and not be biassed
altogether by custom.</p>

best puff paste, well-baked, and rather
inclining to a pale colour, which has a
very good effect.</div>

passing of flour and butter, to each gallon
of liquor half a pint of madeira wine;

be made with pieces of cow-heel or pig's

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
